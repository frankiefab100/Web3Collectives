          in the fourth quarter of 2021, Web3collectives has evolved as an
          online encyclopedia of free educational resources of various trending
          topics in the Blockchain industry.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Started</h2>
        <p>
          We noticed that existing learning resources on blockchain development
          are all over the internet and various platforms. To make it much
          easier for Web3 enthusiasts to access these informations - that was
          how
          <strong> Web3collectives </strong>came about.
