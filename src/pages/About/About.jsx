        Introduction

      <p>
        If you ended up here, youâ€™re probably interested in learning about
        blockchain technology and the decentralized internet (Otherwise known as
        Web3).
      </p>
      <h2>How It Started</h2>
      <p>
        We noticed that existing learning resources about blockchain development
        are all over the different platforms and the internet. To make it much
        easier for Web3 enthusiasts to browse and access information - that was
        how
        <strong> Web3collectives </strong>came about.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project started as a curated list of resources in a
        <a
          href="https://github.com/frankiefab100/Blockchain-Development-Resources"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          github repository.
        </a>
