      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        If you ended up here, youâ€™re probably interested in learning about
        blockchain technology and the decentralized internet (Otherwise known as
        Web3).

      <p>
        We noticed that existing learning resources about blockchain development
        are all over the different platforms and the internet. To make it much
        easier for Web3 enthusiasts to browse and access information,
        Web3collectives was birthed.

        - a collection of free learning resources.
